# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this website as a study guide for my bootcamp prework. I wanted to build it so that I had an easy way to organize and access my notes. It put all of my notes in one place and organized them in a way that makes sense to me. I leanred a lot about different programming langurages and their uses, as well as how to implement them.

Each section in this website contains notes about different topics, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from the prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
